# Gallows

A Phoenix web client for the [Hangman](https://github.com/belgoros/hangman) project developed during [Elixir for programmers](https://codestool.coding-gnome.com/courses/elixir-for-programmers) course with Dave Thomas.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
